Code Explanation:
c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>
Purpose: Includes the standard input/output library for using functions like printf and scanf.
c
Copy code
int main() {
Purpose: Entry point of the program. The main function is where the execution starts.
c
Copy code
    int n, i;
    unsigned long long factorial = 1;
Purpose:
int n, i;: Declares two integer variables: n (to store the number entered by the user) and i (used as a loop counter).
unsigned long long factorial = 1;: Declares a variable factorial to store the result of the factorial calculation. The unsigned long long type is used to handle large values that result from factorial calculations.
c
Copy code
    printf("Enter a positive integer: ");
Purpose: Prompts the user to enter a positive integer.
c
Copy code
    scanf("%d", &n);
Purpose: Reads the user input and stores it in the variable n. The %d format specifier is used to read an integer.
c
Copy code
    if (n < 0) {
        printf("Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\n");
    }
Purpose:
Checks if the entered number n is negative.
If n is less than 0, it prints a message stating that factorial is not defined for negative numbers. No further calculations are done in this case.
c
Copy code
    else {
        for (i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            factorial *= i;
        }
Purpose:
else block: Executes if the input number is non-negative.
for loop:
Initializes i to 1 and iterates up to n.
On each iteration, multiplies factorial by i and updates the value of factorial.
This computes the factorial of n iteratively.
c
Copy code
        printf("Factorial of %d = %llu\n", n, factorial);
    }
Purpose:
Prints the computed factorial.
%d: Prints the value of n as an integer.
%llu: Prints the value of factorial as an unsigned long long integer.
c
Copy code
    return 0;
Purpose: Indicates the program terminated successfully.
Example Execution:
Input:
bash
Copy code
Enter a positive integer: 5
Execution:
n is assigned the value 5.
The else block executes, and the loop computes:
factorial = 1 × 1 = 1
factorial = 1 × 2 = 2
factorial = 2 × 3 = 6
factorial = 6 × 4 = 24
factorial = 24 × 5 = 120
